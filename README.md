# SMESwin-unet


code is based on [Swin Unet](https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/Swin-Unet), [UCtransnet](https://github.com/McGregorWwww/UCTransNet),  External Attention from [fighting cv library](https://github.com/xmu-xiaoma666/External-Attention-pytorch) and scikit learn. Thanks!!!  
I will release the model as soon as possible.  
I am a begginer, there are still lots of things that I need to learn, if you have any suggestions or questions, here is my email wang@med.tohoku.ac.jp
