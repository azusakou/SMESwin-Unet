code is based on [Swin Unet](https://github.com/HuCaoFighting/Swin-Unet), [UCtransnet](https://github.com/McGregorWwww/UCTransNet),  External Attention from [fighting cv library](https://github.com/xmu-xiaoma666/External-Attention-pytorch) and scikit learn. Thanks!!!   
Here is the [link of weights](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7e5gv2rd6tfoiam/AADrgfdMJkUgiSdZW2dbMH-Za?dl=0).  
I am a begginer, there are still lots of things that I need to learn, if you have any suggestions or questions, here is my email wang@med.tohoku.ac.jp

Halfway through this project, it was close to the deadline, so the subsequent part was not completed, but the code and weights for the models are correct here, but the training code is the code of the subsequent model with different parameter settings. Please check the source code from swin unet.
By the way, there was something wrong with my email setting, if I did not reply your email, please send me again.
Sorry for the trouble as a newbie!
